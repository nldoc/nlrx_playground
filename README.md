# Ants gif

The nlrx_ants_gif.R skript provides an example on how to create a gif animation from a NetLogo model containing moving turtles and dynamic patches.
The experiment is set up and run via the nlrx package.
The spatial output data is postprocssed in order to create an animate dplot with gganimate.
